		<h2>Alphabet</h2>
		<p> The Aramaic language is written with various scripts and the Syriac dialects are mainly written with the Syriac alphabet.</p>
		<p> There are three different versions of the Syriac script: <br></p>
		<ol>
			<li><p> Esṭrangelā – the oldest form of Syriac, which best fulfils the purpose of decoration & display. Estrangelā will be used in this book here in the preface. </p></li>
			<li> <p>Serṭā (West Syriac) – a newer version that will be used later on in this book, in the dictionary itself and a part in the preface as well. </p></li>
			<li> <p>East Syriac – also called Maḏnḥāyā or Swāḏāyā </p></li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p> Syriac writing is just like any other abjad-writing, meaning that it's written without vowels. Vowels have been added on as symbols and diatrics in newer times and are frequently used for a more efficient reading experience. </p>

		<p>Syriac is written from right to left with 22 consonants, which are divided into six groups for easier remembering. Unlike the Imperial Aramaic script (which is today known as the Hebrew alphabet), Syriac letters are written together like Arabic or a cursive font in English. Unlike the Latin alphabet, Aramaic does not have uppercase letters. Or another way of seeing it is that Aramaic does not have any lowercase letters. Either way, there are only 22 different letters (consonants). The word alphabet is derived from the Aramaic word ālap̄-beṯ, which is the two first letters of the Aramaic alphabet: <span class="estrangeloMakikho">ܐ</span> (ālap̄) and <span class="estrangeloMakikho">ܒ</span> (bēṯ). <br> Pronounced "alaf" (also transliterated as alaph), and beth. Or with the Western pronunciation: "olaf" and "beth".</p>
		<p>There are two different ways to pronounce the CS vowels. The Western and the Eastern pronunciation. The Eastern pronunciation is older, whilst the Western is influenced by Greek.</p>
		<p>The appearance of Syriac letters varies from the position in the words, if they are in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, or at the end.</p>
