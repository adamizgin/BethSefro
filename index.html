		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<h3>What is Aramaic?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Aramaic is an ancient language spoken mainly by the Aramean people. The language is best known as the language spoken by Jesus Christ. It is divided into multiple dialects: Western Aramaic and Eastern Aramaic. which are divided into subdialects. The differences between the subdialects are minor, as they differ from village to village or city to village. <br><br> The Syriac name of the language has entered as a synonym to Aramaic from the Greek word Syrios (Σύριος). However, the Syriac name is not only used as a synonym to the Aramaic language and the population – as used in the lexicon of the former Archbishop of the Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Urmia: Toma Audo. It has also become a name of a specific dialect of Aramaic: Edessan Aramaic, which is best known as Classical Syriac.</p>
		<p>There are many different Aramaic dialects, so it can be difficult to decide which one to study as a beginner. Although extinct, perhaps you would like to speak Jesus's tongue (Jewish Palestinian "Galilean" Aramaic)?</p>
		<h3>Classical Syriac</h3>
		<p>Why then, out of every Aramaic dialect, do I recommend you to learn and study Classical Syriac?</p>
		<p>when studying Aramaic dialects, one will easily notice that Classical Syriac is not all too different from other dialects from different times like Jewish Palestinian Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic. There are numerous manuscripts written in Classical Syriac, more than any other dialect. There are so many texts that the vocabulary we have in Classical Syriac is far greater than what we have from any other dialect. The reason for this is mainly because of early Christianity. <br> As it said in <em>Acts 11:25–26</em>: Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch. <br> Peter became the first leader of the Church according to tradition as he was the first amongst them to heal anyone (see <em>Acts 3:1–11</em>). <br> Aramaic was at the time Lingua Franca – and Classical Syriac became the main dialect used in the Church of Antioch in literature and liturgy. It has been in use ever since in the Church, which today is known as the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. <br> Although Peter was Jewish, most of the Church fathers in the Syriac Orthodox Church were Arameans overall. By studying Classical Syriac and reading manuscripts and chronicles from the Syriac Orthodox Church, you will understand the culture and mindset of the earliest Christians: of Jesus and His apostles.</p>
		<p>Although Syriac is essential for Christianity, linguistically speaking it's important for other Semitic languages as well. <b>For example</b>, did you know that the Arabic word <em>Qurʾān</em> is related to the Syriac word <em>Qeryānā</em> which means <b>reading</b>?</p>
